@article{liuPearl2007,
	Abstract = {The desire to infer the evolutionary history of a
                  group of species should be more viable now that a
                  considerable amount of multilocus molecular data is
                  available. However, the current molecular
                  phylogenetic paradigm still reconstructs gene trees
                  to represent the species tree. Further, commonly
                  used methods of combining data, such as the
                  concatenation method, are known to be inconsistent
                  in some circumstances. In this paper, we propose a
                  Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the
                  phylogeny of a group of species using multiple
                  estimated gene tree distributions, such as those
                  that arise in a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence
                  data. Our model employs substitution models used in
                  traditional phylogenetics but also uses coalescent
                  theory to explain genealogical signals from species
                  trees to gene trees and from gene trees to sequence
                  data, thereby forming a complete stochastic model to
                  estimate gene trees, species trees, ancestral
                  population sizes, and species divergence times
                  simultaneously. Our model is founded on the
                  assumption that gene trees, even of unlinked loci,
                  are correlated due to being derived from a single
                  species tree and therefore should be estimated
                  jointly. We apply the method to two multilocus data
                  sets of DNA sequences. The estimates of the species
                  tree topology and divergence times appear to be
                  robust to the prior of the population size, whereas
                  the estimates of effective population sizes are
                  sensitive to the prior used in the analysis. These
                  analyses also suggest that the model is superior to
                  the concatenation method in fitting these data sets
                  and thus provides a more realistic assessment of the
                  variability in the distribution of the species tree
                  that may have produced the molecular information at
                  hand. Future improvements of our model and algorithm
                  should include consideration of other factors that
                  can cause discordance of gene trees and species
                  trees, such as horizontal transfer or gene
                  duplication.},

@article{liu2008est,
	Abstract = {Several techniques, such as concatenation and
                  consensus methods, are available for combining data
                  from multiple loci to produce a single statement of
                  phylogenetic relationships. However, when multiple
                  alleles are sampled from individual species, it
                  becomes more challenging to estimate relationships
                  at the level of species, either because
                  concatenation becomes inappropriate due to conflicts
                  among individual gene trees, or because the species
                  from which multiple alleles have been sampled may
                  not form monophyletic groups in the estimated
                  tree. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to
                  reconstruct species trees from multiple-allele,
                  multilocus sequence data, building on a recently
                  proposed method for estimating species trees from
                  single allele multilocus data. A two-step Markov
                  Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is adopted to
                  estimate the posterior distribution of the species
                  tree. The model is applied to estimate the posterior
                  distribution of species trees for two
                  multiple-allele datasets--yeast (Saccharomyces) and
                  birds (Manacus-manakins). The estimates of the
                  species trees using our method are consistent with
                  those inferred from other methods and genetic
                  markers, but in contrast to other species tree
                  methods, it provides credible regions for the
                  species tree. The Bayesian approach described here
                  provides a powerful framework for statistical
                  testing and integration of population genetics and
                  phylogenetics.},

@article{wilson1998gim,
	Abstract = {Ease and accuracy of typing, together with high
                  levels of polymorphism and widespread distribution
                  in the genome, make microsatellite (or short tandem
                  repeat) loci an attractive potential source of
                  information about both population histories and
                  evolutionary processes. However, microsatellite data
                  are difficult to interpret, in particular because of
                  the frequency of back-mutations. Stochastic models
                  for the underlying genetic processes can be
                  specified, but in the past they have been too
                  complicated for direct analysis. Recent developments
                  in stochastic simulation methodology now allow
                  direct inference about both historical events, such
                  as genealogical coalescence times, and evolutionary
                  parameters, such as mutation rates. A feature of the
                  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that we
                  propose here is that the likelihood computations are
                  simplified by treating the (unknown) ancestral
                  allelic states as auxiliary parameters. We
                  illustrate the algorithm by analyzing microsatellite
                  samples simulated under the model. Our results
                  suggest that a single microsatellite usually does
                  not provide enough information for useful
                  inferences, but that several completely linked
                  microsatellites can be informative about some
                  aspects of genealogical history and evolutionary
                  processes. We also reanalyze data from a previously
                  published human Y chromosome microsatellite study,
                  finding evidence for an effective population size
                  for human Y chromosomes in the low thousands and a
                  recent time since their most recent common ancestor:
                  the 95% interval runs from approximately 15, 000 to
                  130,000 years, with most likely values around 30,000

@article{BEAST,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolutionary analysis of molecular
                  sequence variation is a statistical enterprise. This
                  is reflected in the increased use of probabilistic
                  models for phylogenetic inference, multiple sequence
                  alignment, and molecular population genetics. Here
                  we present BEAST: a fast, flexible software
                  architecture for Bayesian analysis of molecular
                  sequences related by an evolutionary tree. A large
                  number of popular stochastic models of sequence
                  evolution are provided and tree-based models
                  suitable for both within- and between-species
                  sequence data are implemented. RESULTS: BEAST
                  version 1.4.6 consists of 81000 lines of Java source
                  code, 779 classes and 81 packages. It provides
                  models for DNA and protein sequence evolution,
                  highly parametric coalescent analysis, relaxed clock
                  phylogenetics, non-contemporaneous sequence data,
                  statistical alignment and a wide range of options
                  for prior distributions. BEAST source code is
                  object-oriented, modular in design and freely
                  available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/ under
                  the GNU LGPL license. CONCLUSION: BEAST is a
                  powerful and flexible evolutionary analysis package
                  for molecular sequence variation. It also provides a
                  resource for the further development of new models
                  and statistical methods of evolutionary analysis.},

@article{JosephFelsenstein03012006,
	Abstract = {A computer simulation study has been made of the
                  accuracy of estimates of {Theta} = 4Ne{micro} from a
                  sample from a single isolated population of finite
                  size. The accuracies turn out to be well predicted
                  by a formula developed by Fu and Li, who used
                  optimistic assumptions. Their formulas are restated
                  in terms of accuracy, defined here as the reciprocal
                  of the squared coefficient of variation. This should
                  be proportional to sample size when the entities
                  sampled provide independent information. Using these
                  formulas for accuracy, the sampling strategy for
                  estimation of {Theta} can be investigated. Two
                  models for cost have been used, a cost-per-base
                  model and a cost-per-read model. The former would
                  lead us to prefer to have a very large number of
                  loci, each one base long. The latter, which is more
                  realistic, causes us to prefer to have one read per
                  locus and an optimum sample size which declines as
                  costs of sampling organisms increase. For realistic
                  values, the optimum sample size is 8 or fewer
                  individuals. This is quite close to the results
                  obtained by Pluzhnikov and Donnelly for a
                  cost-per-base model, evaluating other estimators of
                  {Theta}. It can be understood by considering that
                  the resources spent collecting larger samples
                  prevent us from considering more loci. An
                  examination of the efficiency of Watterson's
                  estimator of {Theta} was also made, and it was found
                  to be reasonably efficient when the number of
                  mutants per generation in the sequence in the whole
                  population is less than 2.5.  },
